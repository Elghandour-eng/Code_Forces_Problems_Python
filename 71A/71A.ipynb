    "Sometimes some words like **\"localization\"** or **\"internationalization\"** are so long that writing them many times in one text is quite tiresome.\n",

    "Let's consider a word too long, if its length is strictly **more than 10 characters**.<br> All too long words should be replaced with a **special abbreviation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.\n",
